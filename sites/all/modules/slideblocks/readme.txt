-- SUMMARY --

Slide Blocks is a Drupal module to create sliding blocks for mobile views.  
Administrators can tag those blocks they want to appear in side tabs, set 
alternate titles, tab colors, and screen width triggers.

-- REQUIREMENTS --

 No other modules are required

-- INSTALLATION --

* Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/895232 for further information.

-- CONFIGURATION --

The general configuratoion is at admin/config/system/slideblocks
There is a switch to turn the function on, a choice between setting 
the tabs on the left or right, the DOM id you'd place the tabs in,
and the margin from the top to push the tabs to.

Otherwise, there is a small configuration on each block to turn it on for side blocks,
to color it, give a mobile title, set the width of the screen that triggers the change, 
and the weight for ordering when there are multiple blocks.
