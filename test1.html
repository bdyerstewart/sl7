<h1>Step 5: Make Your Case: The Written Application</h1>
<div><em>Note: Submit your written statement at least a month before your hearing, if you have requested one. Submit 5 copies to a DRB and 3 copies to a BCMR. Include instructions that one copy should be given to each Board member.</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Your written statement is where you should explain anything you think is wrong in your record and how you have changed if you have had issues with misconduct or discipline.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>You do not need to fit your written statement in the small box on the form. </strong>Most applicants write their statement on a separate sheet of paper and write or type &ldquo;see attached statement&rdquo; on the form.</div>

    <h2>Legal Standards for an Upgrade</h2>
    <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
    <div>The Boards will be thinking about certain key words (quoted in bold below) while they look at your application. You do <u>not</u> need to have a lawyer&rsquo;s help or use complicated arguments to get a discharge upgrade. However, it can be useful to know what the Board is looking for.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <h3><strong><em>Discharge Review Board (DRB)</em></strong></h3>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><strong>The DRBs review whether your discharge is &ldquo;proper&rdquo; and &ldquo;equitable</strong>.&rdquo; The board will consider each application on a case-by-case basis. The DRB makes certain legal assumptions that your application must show are false before they will grant you a discharge upgrade. You can directly challenge each assumption by saying, for example, &ldquo;My discharge was improper&rdquo; and then explaining why. The requirements for each are important to consider.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>The Board will assume that your discharge was &ldquo;<strong>proper&rdquo;</strong> unless:</div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>the military made an &ldquo;error of fact, law, procedure, or discretion&rdquo; in deciding your discharge, and there is &ldquo;substantial doubt&rdquo; that you would have gotten the same discharge if the military had not made the error.</div>
            <ul>
                <li>The first part means that the military got something wrong with the facts or the reasoning behind your discharge. The second part means that there must be reason to believe, if the mistake had not been made, that you would have received a different discharge.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div><strong>OR</strong></div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>there has been a change in policy that requires that you receive a different discharge.</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <div>This means that you should be able to point to a change in official policy since you were discharged. The new policy needs to apply retroactively (meaning it declares that even things that happened in the past should have followed this new policy).</div>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div>The Board will assume that your discharge was &ldquo;<strong>equitable&rdquo;</strong> unless:</div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>you were discharged because of policies that are different in important ways from the current policies, <strong>and</strong></div>
        </li>
        <li>the current policies are better for veterans who are being discharged, <strong>and</strong></li>
        <li>there is &ldquo;substantial doubt&rdquo; that you would have received the same discharge under the new policies.
            <ul>
                <li>Is there some better policy in place and do you have reason to believe that policy would have helped you when you were discharged? An example of this might be the Kurta Memo (see page 6), which provides special consideration for servicemembers who show signs of Post-Tramautic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). If you had a documented history of mental health problems or symptoms and were discharged despite those symptoms, you may be able to say that the discharge was &ldquo;inequitable&rdquo; under current policies.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
    <h3><strong><em>Board for Correction of Military Records (BCMR)</em></strong></h3>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>BCMRs may correct any record when the fix is necessary to <strong>&ldquo;correct an error or remove an injustice.&rdquo;</strong> Each of these possibilities (&ldquo;correct an error&rdquo; or &ldquo;remove an injustice&rdquo;) allow the BCMR to grant your upgrade if they believe that your discharge was incorrect or unjust. What this means, exactly, depends on your specific circumstances. Some believe that these the BCMRs are looking for similar information as the DRBs, although the law does not define the words it uses.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>You should note that discharges that were issued by a special or general court-martial may only be upgraded <strong>&ldquo;for purposes of clemency&rdquo;</strong> (meaning they can intentionally forgive a sentence). If you fall into this category, it is especially important to include information about good post-service conduct, including things like holding a stable job, volunteering in your community, and avoiding getting in trouble.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>Like DRBs, BCMRs will assume that your original records are correct unless there is enough evidence to show that they should be changed.</div>

        <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
        <h2><a>Tailoring Your Written Statement to the Legal Standards</a></h2>
        <div>As explained above, the DRBs and the BCMRs use different legal standards to review your application. Based on which Board you&rsquo;re applying to, you will want to use different key words (bolded below).</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
            <h3><strong><em>For a DRB (which reviews </em></strong><strong><em>if a discharge is &ldquo;proper&rdquo; and &ldquo;equitable&rdquo;):</em></strong></h3>

                        <li>Mention any errors made in your discharge process. Explain why your discharge would have been different if these errors had not been made.</li>
                        <li>If a relevant military policy has changed since your discharge, mention it, and show why it would require a change to your discharge.
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Note: To apply to your case, a new policy must say it applies <strong>retroactively</strong> (meaning it applies to past discharges).</em></li>
